# An-Autonomous-Reforestation-Mission
This project is an Arduino-based autonomous robot designed to follow a black path and plant seeds in designated areas (green and blue zones). The robot utilizes infrared (IR) sensors for path tracking and a color sensor to detect planting zones, triggering a servo motor to execute the seed-planting mechanism.
