# An-Autonomous-Reforestation-Mission
This project is an Arduino-based autonomous robot designed to follow a black path and plant seeds in designated areas (green and blue zones). The robot utilizes infrared (IR) sensors for path tracking and a color sensor to detect planting zones, triggering a servo motor to execute the seed-planting mechanism.

### Prerequisites

1. Download and Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
   - Required for compiling and uploading the code to the Arduino Nano Board.

2. Required Hardware:
   - Arduino Nano Board
   - 2 IR Sensors (for path tracking)
   - 1 Color Sensor (for planting zone detection)
   - 2 Power Motors + Motor Driver
   - 1 Servo Motor (for seed planting)
   - Rechargeable Battery
   - Breadboard & Wiring Components
